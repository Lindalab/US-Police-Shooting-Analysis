# US-Police-Shooting-Analysis
Analyzed a dataset using PowerBI to gain insight into Police shooting in 2287 cities in the US


Key Insights
The analysis reveals that a total of 4895 deaths were recorded, with an average victim age of 37 years. The majority of these deaths occurred among individuals
aged 20 to 40, peaking at age 30. A steady decline in deaths was observed from 2015 to 2020. Notably, 95.46% of the victims were male, and 94.93% were killed by gunshots. Additionally, most incidents were not related to mental illness, and 88.19% of cases lacked body camera recordings.

Analysis
The data indicates a clear demographic pattern, with younger males, particularly around age 30, being disproportionately affected. White individuals made up the largest racial group among victims, followed by Black individuals. Despite the declining trend in deaths, the high use of guns as the primary weapon and the minimal presence of body cameras are concerning, as they suggest both excessive force and a lack of transparency in many incidents.

Trends
A notable trend is the decrease in police killings from over 900 deaths in 2015 to fewer than 400 in 2020, reflecting potential improvements in law enforcement policies or reporting practices. The data also shows that a majority of victims were not fleeing at the time of their deaths, which raises questions about the use of force during non-threatening situations.

Implications
These findings have profound implications for law enforcement practices and policy reforms. The disproportionate impact on certain racial groups, particularly Black individuals, highlights issues of systemic bias within policing. The lack of body camera footage in most incidents undermines accountability, making it difficult to assess the circumstances surrounding many deaths.

Recommendations
It is recommended that law enforcement agencies increase the use of body cameras to ensure greater transparency and accountability. Further, de-escalation training and bias reduction programs should be prioritized to reduce unnecessary use of force, especially in non-threatening scenarios. Special attention should be given to addressing the racial disparities revealed in the data, focusing on improving police-community relations.

Conclusions
The analysis of police killings in the USA highlights several areas of concern, including the high use of deadly force, racial disparities among victims, and the lack of accountability mechanisms such as body cameras. While there is evidence of a declining trend in deaths, significant reforms are still needed to ensure that policing practices are both just and transparent.
